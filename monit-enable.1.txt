== NAME ==

monit-enable, monit-disable - enable or disable a monit configuration parts

== SYNOPSIS ==

monit-enable [ file ]

monit-disable [ file ]

== DESCRIPTION ==

This manual page documents briefly the *monit-enable* and *monit-disable*
commands.

*monit-enable* is a script that enables the specified parts within the monit
configuration. It does this by creating symlinks within
/etc/monit/svc-enabled.

Likewise, *monit-disable* disables parts by removing those symlinks. It is
not an error to enable a part which is already enabled, or to disable one
which is already disabled.

== BUGS ==

No time to include bugs, command actions might seldom lead astray user's
assumption.
