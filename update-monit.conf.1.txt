== NAME ==

update-monit.conf, update-monit.conf.conf - update monit configuration parts


== SYNOPSIS ==

update-monit.conf

== DESCRIPTION ==

This manual page documents briefly the *update-monit.conf* command.

*update-monit.conf* is a script that updates the specified parts within the
monit configuration located in /etc/monit/svc-available.in.

The update process creates a /etc/monit/svc-available directory by replacing
macros from /etc/monit/svc-available.in according their definition in
/etc/monit/update-monit.conf.conf.

/etc/monit/update-monit.conf.conf is a shell sourced script. Any king of
variable could be defined within it. Those variables would be expanded
during the update process.

A macro is defined within '@@'.

== EXAMPLE ==

If /etc/monit/update-monit.conf.conf contains:

----
ALERT_EMAIL="monit@example.com"
----

If /etc/monit/svc-available.in/emailrc contains:

----
set alert @@ALERT_EMAIL@@ with reminder on 10 cycles
----

The resulting file /etc/monit/svc-available/emailrc would contain:

----
set alert monit@example.com with reminder on 10 cycles
----

== FILES ==

assumption.
